# Swen222Game
Swen222 game for assignment 2. Game is similar to Chess, use the panels on the left to choose and a select a piece to play, you may move each piece once per turn. Each Piece is a box with a circle and some lines in it. Aim of game is to get a 'sword' adjacent to an opponents face.

Lines from the centre are 'swords', lines at the edges are 'sheilds' when you put a sword adjacent to something else a reaction occurs. The type of reaction is based on the adjacent side. Rotation and what side is adjacent to what is very important.

Two phases of each turn CREATION - you can create a piece assuming your creation spot(the colored square) is free and MOVEMENT/ROTATION, you can rotate/move each of your pieces once per turn.
